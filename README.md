# Stack
This project is a C++ template-based stack implementation with key operations: push, pop, view top, and display. It features an interactive, menu-driven console program where users can specify the stack size and perform operations with continuous feedback. The base Stack class extends a MyStack class, making it flexible for various data types. ðŸš€
